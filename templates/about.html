              <h2>Why did you make Mobile LotW?</h2>
              <p>Soon after I earned my General license in 2021 I became frustrated by how 
              difficult it is to use the ARRL's <a href="http://lotw.arrl.org/">Logbook of the World</a> 
              website on mobile phones. After waiting a few years for the ARRL to fix 
              the problem, I decided to fix it for myself. Then, as I got into the project, I figured 
              why not share my fix with others? The result is Mobile LotW.</p>
                
  
              <h2>How does Mobile LotW work?</h2>
              <p>When you view a page in Mobile LotW, like the DXCC Award 
              Info page, what happens behind the scenes is Mobile LotW downloads your DXCC Award Info page 
              from LotW, reformats it to look nice on your phone, and then shows it to you. That's it!</p>

              <h2>Does Mobile LotW store my LotW password?</h2>
              <p>Mobile LotW does NOT store your LotW password. When you enter your LotW username and
              password into Mobile LotW and click the Login button, your username and password is used to log you 
              into the LotW site in the background. Then the page you requested is downloaded and reformatted for 
		          your phone.</p>

<!--//                <h2>What's next for Mobile LotW?</h2>  
                <p>I'm currently testing a new feature where Mobile LotW sends you an email when you receive a new QSL
		   through LotW. Personally, I'm loving it. I'm trying to figure out how to make this available to 
		  Mobile LotW users in a way that doesn't break the bank.</p>

                <h2>How do I get involved in Mobile LotW?</h2>  
                <p>Mobile LotW is open source software, built with Python and Flask, which means you can 
                  contribute to its development! Check out the Mobile LotW repo on GitHub (link coming soon).
